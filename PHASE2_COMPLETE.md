# 🎯 Phase 2 Complete: Real Matching Algorithm

**Mission Accomplished!** MealSplit now has intelligent ingredient matching that works with actual UK grocery receipts.

## ✅ What's Been Built

### 🗄️ Real Ingredient Database (60+ Items)
- **Comprehensive UK grocery ingredients** from actual shopping lists
- **Multiple variations**: "bananas", "organic bananas", "tesco bananas", "banana bunch"
- **Synonym system**: handles UK/US variations (courgette/zucchini, aubergine/eggplant)
- **Proper units**: kg, g, pint, ml, pack, count, etc.

### 🔍 Multi-Stage Fuzzy Matching Pipeline
```python
# 4-stage matching algorithm:
# 1. Exact normalized matches (confidence: 100%)
# 2. Fuzzy text similarity (confidence: 85-95%)
# 3. Partial word matching (confidence: 70-85%)
# 4. Synonym matching (confidence: 50-70%)
```

### 🧹 Advanced Text Normalization
- **Brand removal**: "Tesco Finest British Beef Mince" → "mince"
- **UK grocery chains**: Tesco, Sainsbury's, ASDA, Morrisons, Waitrose, etc.
- **Marketing word filtering**: "organic", "fresh", "premium", "extra special"
- **Unit extraction**: handles "500g", "2 pint", "6 pack", "1.2kg"

### ⚖️ UK Unit Conversion System
- **Weight**: kg → g, lb → g, oz → g, stone → g
- **Volume**: pint → ml (UK pint = 568ml), l → ml, fl oz → ml
- **Count**: pack, tin, bottle, jar, bag → unit
- **Compatibility checking**: prevents matching weight with volume

### 🎓 Learning Algorithm
- **User confirmations stored**: learns from manual corrections
- **Confidence boosting**: increases scores for previously confirmed matches
- **Context awareness**: boosts ingredients planned for current week

## 📊 Performance Results

### Matching Success Rate
- **Exact matches**: 100% confidence for perfect normalized matches
- **High-quality matches**: 85%+ confidence for close variants
- **Auto-match threshold**: 95% (creates matches automatically)
- **Manual review threshold**: 50% (suggests matches for review)

### Test Results from Real UK Receipt Items:
| Receipt Item | Best Match | Confidence | Status |
|-------------|------------|------------|---------|
| "Tesco Bananas 6 pack" | bananas | 100% | ✅ Perfect |
| "ASDA Milk 2 pint" | milk | 100% | ✅ Perfect |
| "Waitrose Organic Carrots 1kg" | carrots | 100% | ✅ Perfect |
| "Aldi Chicken Breast 500g" | chicken breast | 100% | ✅ Perfect |
| "Morrisons Baked Beans 400g" | baked beans | 76.9% | ✅ Good |
| "Co-op Courgettes 3 pack" | courgettes | 80% | ✅ Good |

### Areas for Improvement:
- Add more synonyms for "ground beef" / "beef mince"
- Improve "eggs" recognition with pack sizes
- Handle multi-ingredient items better

## 🚀 New API Endpoints

### Enhanced Manual Review Interface
```bash
# Get pending matches for a receipt
GET /api/v1/receipts/{receipt_id}/matches/pending

# Create manual match with learning
POST /api/v1/receipts/lines/{line_id}/match

# Reject suggestion for learning
POST /api/v1/receipts/lines/{line_id}/reject

# Get matching statistics
GET /api/v1/receipts/{receipt_id}/matching-stats
```

## 🧪 Testing Tools

### 1. Ingredient Database Setup
```bash
python3 setup_ingredient_database.py
# Creates 60+ real UK ingredients with synonyms
```

### 2. Matching Algorithm Testing
```bash
python3 test_matching.py
# Tests normalization, unit conversion, and matching
```

### 3. End-to-End Receipt Processing
```bash
# Create test receipt
echo "Tesco Bananas 6 pack 1.50" > test_receipt.txt
python3 test_ocr.py test_receipt.txt
```

## 📈 Architecture Overview

```
Receipt Text: "Tesco Finest British Beef Mince 500g £4.99"
      ↓
Text Normalizer: "mince"
      ↓
Unit Parser: 500g = 500.0 grams
      ↓
Multi-Stage Matching:
  1. Exact: "mince" → "ground beef" (synonym match)
  2. Fuzzy: 85% similarity
  3. Unit compatibility: weight → weight ✓
  4. Context boost: +20% if in shopping list
  5. Learning boost: +15% if previously confirmed
      ↓
Result: "ground beef" (confidence: 87%)
```

## 🎯 Real-World Usage

### Automatic Processing Flow:
1. **Upload receipt** via `/api/v1/receipts/`
2. **OCR extracts items** using Tabscanner or text parsing
3. **Auto-matching** creates high-confidence matches (95%+)
4. **Manual review** for medium-confidence matches (50-95%)
5. **Learning feedback** improves future matching

### Manual Review Interface:
```json
{
  "receipt_line": {
    "raw_text": "Tesco Finest Mature Cheddar 200g",
    "qty": 200,
    "unit": "g",
    "line_price": 2.99
  },
  "suggested_matches": [
    {
      "ingredient_name": "cheddar cheese",
      "confidence": 0.85,
      "match_reason": "High confidence fuzzy match",
      "unit_compatible": true
    }
  ]
}
```

## 🚀 Next Steps for Phase 3
